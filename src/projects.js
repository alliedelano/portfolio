Happy Trails is an app that helps parents spend less time on research and more time out on the trails. From the homepage, users can view a list of trails and search for trails based on amenities and by location. After creating an account, users can see trail details, add new trails to the database, update information about trails, comment on trails to let others know what to expect, and access a list of their trails."

        additionalDetails: "Once you click 'start,' you'll learn the backstory and begin the game. From there, it's easy - all you have to do to beat each level is repeat the sequence your opponent displays on Simon! There are four colors: blue, green, red, and yellow. Your opponent's moves are randomly generated based on world and level and will 'light up' in order. After they're done, it'll be your turn to repeat their sequence. If you're successful, you'll move on to the next level! If not, you'll lose a life and repeat the level, usually against a new opponent. If you lose all of your lives, you lose the game and have an opportunity to replay from the beginning. As you beat levels, you'll build a path across the screen. Every five levels, you'll complete a 'world' and an element of the sea will regain its color: first the reef path at the bottom, then the sand, then the water itself. Once you fill in the entire path and beat the final level, you win the game!"

It's easy - all you have to do is repeat what Simon says. There are four colors: blue, green, red, and yellow. Simon will choose a random color, 'light up' that button, then give you a chance to copy what he did. Once you do, Simon will repeat his sequence and add a random move. If you successfully copy what he did, he'll add another, and another, and another. The game ends when you make a move that wasn't in Simon's sequence, but he'll ask if you want to play again."
